## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this 3-hour workshop, learners will be able to:

1. **Initialize and manage version-controlled projects** – Create a local Git repository, make meaningful commits with clear messages, and understand why version control is essential for collaborative data science projects.

2. **Collaborate effectively on GitHub** – Push code to GitHub, create and merge pull requests, and resolve basic merge conflicts when working with teammates on shared projects.

3. **Execute a complete data science workflow** – Set up a project locally in VS Code, write and test Python code, connect to Google Colab for cloud-based experimentation, and sync results back to GitHub for team sharing.
